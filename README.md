# Hello! 🤓


I'm Murilo, with a bachelor degree in Production Engineering and a Master's in Economics and Business Administration. 
I have solid experience in cost management and controllership, acquired throughout my career in large companies. 
Currently, I am enhancing my knowledge in data analysis, focusing on tools such as Power Query, Power BI, SQL, and Python.
My career path combines a strong technical foundation with a keen eye for detail, always striving to optimize processes and generate valuable insights. 
I believe that the integration of engineering, economics and data analysis enables me to understand challenges comprehensively and propose innovative solutions.
I'm passionate about learning and solving complex problems, and I'm always looking for new opportunities to apply my knowledge and grow professionally.
